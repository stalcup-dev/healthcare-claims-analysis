# Decision Memo: Healthcare Claims Analysis

**Date**: Generated by pipeline (reproducible)

## Goal

Analyze healthcare claims data to identify cost drivers, cost concentration patterns, and potential high-cost populations for targeted intervention.

## Key Findings

1. **Total billed amount**: $297,191.00 across 1,000 patients in 1,000 claims.
2. **Average claim**: $297.19 (PMPM: $297.19); diagnosis spectrum is broad (100 unique codes).
3. **Cost concentration**: Top 1% of patients account for 1.7% of total cost; top 10% account for 16.1%.
4. **Top diagnosis**: Code A05.4 drives 1.98% of total cost, indicating a key clinical driver.
5. **Anomalies detected**: 0 patients flagged as high-cost outliers (z-score ≥ 3.0).

## So What

- **Pareto opportunity**: The top 10% of patients represent 16.1% of spend; disease management or care coordination targeting this cohort could yield significant ROI.
- **Clinical focus**: Diagnosis A05.4 is a material cost driver; consider prevention/management programs to address this condition in the population.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Segment patients** into utilization tiers (1%, 5%, 10%) and pilot targeted interventions (e.g., case management, preventive screenings) with the highest tier.
2. **Focus on A05.4 management**: Analyze root causes, develop educational materials, and measure improvement metrics (e.g., claim frequency, severity trend).
3. **Establish dashboards** to monitor cost concentration, anomaly flags, and top diagnoses monthly; ensure action items are tracked and closed.

## Limitations & Risks

- **Synthetic data**: This analysis uses synthetic healthcare claims; patterns may not reflect real-world distributions. Results should be validated against actual claims.
- **Temporal scope**: Analysis covers a fixed date range; seasonal or multi-year trends are not visible. Recommend rolling monthly re-analysis.
- **Missing context**: No clinical outcomes, member demographics, or provider performance data; insights are cost-centric only.
